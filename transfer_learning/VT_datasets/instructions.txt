In this folder, you can find the .mat files used for training and testing the AI architecture to localise scar-related VT episodes
from ECGs or EGMs.

At the moment, the folder only contains real VT signals as the files for simulated signals (post-processed in matlab)
are too large. If you want to run python tests scripts, please contact me (sofia.monaci.5@gmail.com) and I will give you access
to simulation data
