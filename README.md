## ABOUT

This platform allows to test a pre-trained DL architecture on a scar-related VT ECG/EGM trace to predict corresponding exit site. There is also the possibility to re-train the first part of the pipeline after adding new pacing simulations to the existing pacing dataset. The network then needs to be re-trained on the simulated scar-related VT traces

This repository also contains files to generate virtual, simplistic scars around a mesh of interest.
