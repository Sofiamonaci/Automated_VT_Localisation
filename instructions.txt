This github folder contains scripts to localise VT exit sites from ECGs/EGMs.

In order to localise such sites, we first need to train the AI architecure on SIMULATED FOCAL PACED BEATS signals.
This can be done by running
./initial_pacing/tests/test_initial_pacing.py
At the moment, the simulated training datasets are not here in GITHUB but you can email me (sofia.monaci.5@gmail.com) and I will give you access
(so before running the script, please make sure to initialise a valid training dataset file). However, I have already uploaded the trained models in
./initial_pacing/trained_models

In case you are NOT interested in training the AI architecture, and you want to use MY TRAINED MODELS, you can proceed and test the second
part of the algorithm.
./transfer_learning/tests/test_transfer_learning.py
You only need to CHANGE the name/path of the TEST FILE (line 33).
At the moment, the script utilises the already trained models that can be found in 
./transfer_learning/trained_models
./initial_pacing/trained_models

Once you have trained and/or tested the models, you can proceed and compute the actual localised point (and corresponding localisation error if
a ground truth is provided).
./localisation/tests/test_localisation.py
